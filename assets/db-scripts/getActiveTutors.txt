SELECT s.firstName, ta.courseID, t.imgPath
FROM tutor t, tutor_ability ta, student s
WHERE t.tutorID = ta.tutorID and
	t.studentID = s.studentID and
        t.tutorID in (	SELECT tutorID
        				FROM work_visit
                        WHERE endTime is null);

This script returns a recordset like the following:

Name 	Class 	imgPath
Conner	CS150	NULL
Conner	CS180	NULL
Conner 	CS213	NULL
Nick 	CS150	NULL
...

I don't know of a better way to do this from SQL, as the result will always be a grid (with duplicate values), so they'll have to be parsed in JS..
